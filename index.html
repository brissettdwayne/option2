Growing up, I had high hopes of being a football star, but was always told that I should have a "Plan B." I was never assisted in finding that "Plan B" nor was I offered the tools to actually find it myself. Option 2 does just that! I couldn't have thought of a better solution to a nationwide issue for most young athletes.</h4>
